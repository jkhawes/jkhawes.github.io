In a rapidly urbanizing and warming world, we are confronted with the challenge of simultaneously planning for food-energy-water systems and cities that are more environmentally sustainable, more resilient to climate change, and more just for residents. These outcomes, from the scale of individuals to regions, are shaped by assemblages of resource-provisioning infrastructures, institutions, and ecosystems. However, environmental, economic, and social outcomes are difficult to assess in parallel, leaving us with key questions about their complementarity. Specifically, to what degree can transformation of urban built, social, and natural systems promote synergies in sustainability, resilience, and justice? To what degree are tradeoffs inevitable? And how can we better measure and predict these tradeoffs and synergies in order to design and plan for a better urban future?

Our research and teaching address the challenge of planning and designing systems to be more sustainable, resilient and just. We are interdisciplinary scholars of coupled natural-human systems, drawing on theory and methods from planning, geography, and engineering. This work focuses on understanding sustainability, resilience, and justice outcomes across scales. To do this, we study the built, natural, and social structures which shape these outcomes, pointing us towards design and planning interventions for some of our stickiest social-environmental crises. Our ongoing work is examing sustainability, resilience, and justice tradeoffs and synergies in the context of urban agriculture, critical infrastructure, and housing, among other topics. Past and ongoing research has been supported by NSF, USDA, and Sea Grant. 

The lab is led by Jake Hawes, Assistant Professor of Computing and Environment at the University of Wyoming. Jake is co-appointed between the School of Computing and Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources and can supervise MS students in either program. Prior to Jake's time in Laramie, he earned his PhD from the University of Michigan School of Environment and Sustainability. He also earned a bachelor's degree in Environmental and Ecological Engineering and a masterâ€™s degree in Natural Resources Social Science, both from Purdue University. For more information on Jake's research, teaching, and other professional interests, see specific topic areas below.
